Alhamdulillah Alhamdulillah Alhamdulillahi Robil Alamin, Another Ramadan completed with the help of Almighty Allah,
 though this was done during a challenging period but with Allah's mercy upon us he made it easy for us and counted us among those who were able to complete it,
I implore us to continue with the good deeds we have acquitted ourselves with during the Ramadan period, 
and I pray Almighty  Allah accept all our Fast, Salat, Zakat and every other Good deed as an act of Ibadah(Worship) and
 forgive all our sins, 
and I protect us throughout this pandemic period and after.

 _Taqabbala Llaahu minnaa wa minkum._ 

*HAPPY EID-IL-FITRI*
*STAY SAFE.*

*OLORII CARES*
